abstract: >-
  We introduce a unified deep learning method that solves
  dynamic economic models by casting them into nonlinear
  regression equations. We derive such equations for three
  fundamental objects of economic dynamics â€“ lifetime reward
  functions, Bellman equations and Euler equations. We
  estimate the decision functions on simulated data using a
  stochastic gradient descent method. We introduce an
  all-in-one integration operator that facilitates
  approximation of high-dimensional integrals. We use neural
  networks to perform model reduction and to handle
  multicollinearity. Our deep learning method is tractable
  in large-scale problems, e.g., Krusell and Smith (1998).
  We provide a TensorFlow code that accommodates a variety
  of applications.
