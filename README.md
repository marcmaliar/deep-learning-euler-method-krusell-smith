# Deep-Learning code for solving Krusell-Smith heterogeneous-agent model

This code solves the Krusell-Smith heterogeneous-agent model using the Euler method. It was written by Marc Maliar and Serguei Maliar following the JME paper ([link](https://web.stanford.edu/~maliars/Files/JME2021.pdf)).

The code is presented in the style of an Econ-Ark REMARK ([link](https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK)). The actual code is located in code/python/Main_KS.ipynb.

## Running the code

The code can be run either locally or through Binder on the web. To run it in Binder, click the link below

Click this -> [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/marcmaliar/deep-learning-euler-method-krusell-smith/main?labpath=code%2Fpython%2FMain_KS.ipynb)

To run it locally, you can

- run reproduce_jupyter.sh, which opens the code in a Jupyter notebook.
- (reproduce.sh is deprecated and does the same thing as reproduce_jupyter.sh)

Results figure is saved to the figures directory.
