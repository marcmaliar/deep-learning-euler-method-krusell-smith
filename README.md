# Deep-Learning code for solving Krusell-Smith heterogeneous-agent model

This code solves the Krusell-Smith heterogeneous-agent model using the Euler method. It was written by Marc Maliar and Serguei Maliar following the JME paper ([link](https://web.stanford.edu/~maliars/Files/JME2021.pdf)).

The code is presented in the style of an Econ-Ark REMARK ([link](https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK)). The actual code is located in code/python/Main_KS.ipynb.

## Running the code

The code can be run either locally or through Binder on the web. To run it in Binder, click the link below

To run it locally, you can

- run reproduce.sh, which runs the code and saves the figure in the figures directory or
- run reproduce_jupyter.sh, which opens the code in a Jupyter notebook.

The figure (losses plot, decision rules, and model simulation) is stored under the figures directory.
